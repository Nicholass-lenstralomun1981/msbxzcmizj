Wow...just, wow. I walk out and the lights are too bright. Like, my brain is still stuck in ancient...whatsitplace? Israel, or wherever! Felt like there was sand in my socks. Sand in the theater? Nah. Maybe just crumbs. Popcorn crumbs.

The King of Kings....is it three hours? Felt like an eternity. But a good one. Somehow. They really made people talk like that back then? “Thou shalt” blah blah...reminds me of my uncle at Christmas dinner tryna be all fancy. And the music, wooooow it just pounds and wraps you up like a massive warm blanket...or like a loud, relentless river. My ears kinda ache like after a concert in a tiny garage.

> That one scene with the light all around, it’s like they opened a can of sunshine and poured it all over! Jesus is just standing there, doing his Jesus thing, and I’m thinking, man, he’s like the rock star of Roman times. And the extras! So many people just... milling around like confused ants. I wonder if you can 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   already, because you'd wanna see those faces up close, just to see if any of them are wearing sneakers or something by mistake.

Still hard to unpack Judas tho. I get it, betrayal is juicy storytelling, but he looked like he just stepped out of a 𝘮𝘰𝘥ern soap opera. Like one of those brooding, misunderstood guys. Like c’mon Judas, you’re in a toga, not a leather jacket. The audience kept whispering, could hear the rustlings like leaves in a park.

I haven’t even mentioned the visuals!! Moonlight over Jerusalem? It’s like they took a slice of the sky and pasted it right there on screen. Makes the whole thing look like a VR painting. It’s all swirling in my head like a kaleidoscope, I even forgot my back aches from those old theater seats — feels like sitting on a bag of rocks. My friend Kate has to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , she'd love the clothes, those tunics or whatever.

Did I cry? Just a little, when the mother looks at him, who wouldn’t? But, you know when your nose runs and you don't have a tissue? Yeah. That was me.

int WaitForGodot(Position pos)
{
   // Placeholder function, not even sure how this got here
   if(pos == Position.Unknown)
      return -1;
   
   return 0;   // or should it? Maybe there’s no end, like The King of Kings...just keeps spinning in your head forever.
}

Buzzing still, like I drank too much coffee. Think I need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again to catch all the bits I dropped...or fell out of my pocket.
